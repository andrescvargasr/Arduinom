1. Raspbian.

 In this first step desktop version is used (Raspbian Stretch with Desktop).

 1.3. Installation

 To complete the operative system installation, it is recommended to use [class 10 microSD card](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/microsd-cards-for-android-how-to-choose-capacity-speed/) which guarantees a speed of at least 10 MB/s; also, it is recommended to do all the work from a Linux environment, since several packages and programs used do not need any additional installation of third-party software or components.

 On the Raspberry page (see Figure 2) you can find all the information [about installation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).
